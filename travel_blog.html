    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>In 2011, I traveled for 3 months. I visited Bangkok and Chiang Mai in Thailand, Siam Reap in Cambodia, and traveled across the whole South Island of New Zealand. In New Zealand, I completed one of the "great treks", a 3 day hike through the Fjordlands National Park, on the Routeburn trek. These three months were some of the hardest of my life, but also some of the best.</p> 

    <p>In 2014, I had the opportunity to travel again, this time for 12-24 months. While I absolutely loved my work as a psychologist, I just could not pass down this chance to travel again. I quit my job, sold most of my possessions, and hit the road. I travel light, usually with just a backpack and a laptop.</p>

    <p>In 2014, I traveled across the northern USA, a hiked in Glacier National Park, Yellowstone National Park, and Wind Cave National Park. In December, I spent 6 weeks in Southern Spain. As of January, 2015, I am in Chiang Mai, Thailand.</p>
