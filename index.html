  <div class="nomad">
    <h2>Nomad</h2>
    <p>My home base is in Seattle, Washington, USA, but I am currently traveling for an extended period of time. I have spent time in Thailand, Cambodia, Spain, Australia, and New Zealand. Next up, I'll be travelling to Vietnam. I love experiencing new cultures, learning new languages, and seeing how the local people live in each place. I keep up a <a href=https://annactravels.wordpress.com/>travel blog</a> when I am on the road, feel free to check it out!</p>

  <div class="clinician">
    <h2>Clinical Psychologist</h2>
    <p>I have a PhD in Clinical Psychology, and am a licensed clinical psychologist in the state of Washington. My speciality is health psychology. I specialize in treating adults who are experiencing mood problems like depression and anxiety and health conditions like cancer and chronic pain. I believe strongly in helping people live better, no matter what is going on their lives. My approach is flexible, but I have a strong preference to cognitive-behavioral therapies (CBT) and teaching stress management skills.</p>

    <h2>Programmer</h2>
    <p>As I travel, I have been learning web development. In fact, I wrote this website! I am using Jekyll as my new blogging platform, which should be up and running by March 2015. I have created a simple pomodoro timer to run in the console using Ruby, and I am planning to soup up that timer into a full on app sometime in 2015.</p>

  <div class="researcher">
    <h2>Research Scientist</h2>
    <p>My doctoral research project focused on creating a mindfulness meditation based program for first year college students to help prevent depression in what is often an extremely stressful year. Other research projects I have worked on include the NIH-funded Health SMART intervention for women at risk for breast and ovarian cancer with Dr. Bonnie McGregor at the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Institute, neurological signs of PTSD in Vietnam Veterans with Dr. Tamara Gurvitz and the research group at the Manchester NH VA, as well as interventions to prevent depression in adolescents with my graduate school advisor Dr. Amy H. Mezulis.</p>
